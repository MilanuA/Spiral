## Overview
This project is a simple algorithmic project that creates a spiral pattern based on user input, implemented in Unity using C#.

## How it Works
The spiral is created by iteratively adding points to a Line Renderer component in Unity. The algorithm adjusts the position of each point based on the specified spiral size and delta.

## Input Parameters
- **Spiral Size**: Specifies the overall size of the spiral.
- **Delta**: Determines the rate at which the spiral expands or contracts.
